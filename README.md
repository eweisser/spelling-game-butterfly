# spelling-game-butterfly
A game in which players catch butterflies in their net to spell words.

These programs, written in Javascript, are intended to supplement books 3 and 7 of "STORIX", a Korean EFL book series for kindergarten-age students published by Yeamoonsa. The games do not include any copyrighted material; they only incorporate the target vocabulary from these books.

In the game, butterflies fly all over the screen, carrying the letters that players need to spell a set of specific vocabulary words. An image at the top of the page indicates the word that needs to be spelled; only one word is elicited at a time. Butterflies and their letters are caught by moving the player's net (the cursor) near them and clicking to swing the net forward. The words must be spelled in the correct order to proceed, although there are no penalties for catching butterflies with the wrong letters.
